# GDR NBODY

The GDR NBODY - problème quantique à N corps en chimie et physique (https://wiki.lct.jussieu.fr/gdrnbody) - created in 2019, is a research network that aims to bring together the community working on the quantum N-body problem, mostly from the viewpoint of quantum chemistry, but also including the viewpoints of condensed-matter physics, nuclear physics, and mathematics. The idea is to foster the development of new computational methods in quantum mechanics, the transfer of these methods from one discipline to another, and their efficient computer implementations.

# SECOND GENERAL MEETING

This second general meeting is organized around 12 keynote speakers from quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, mathematics, and nuclear physics. A large number of contributed talks will be proposed in order to allow PhD students, postdocs and researchers to present their latest work.
