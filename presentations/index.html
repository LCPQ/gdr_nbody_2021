<p><strong>DFT for two-dimensional homogeneous slabs</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, we study DFT models for homogeneous 2-d slabs in the 3-d space, and derive reduced equations in the direction orthogonal to the slab. We show in particular that the Pauli principle is replaced by a penalization term in the energy. We show how to solve these new equations, and we provide some properties for the minimizer, such as the decay of the density away from the slab.
This is joint work with Salma Lahbabi and Abdallah Maichine</p>

<p><strong>Numerical methods for scattering and resonance properties in molecules and solids</strong></p>
<p>The problem of discretizing continuum states appears in a number of
contexts in electronic structure: scattering problems, photo-ionization
cross-sections, resonances, etc. The numerical challenge is to represent
extended states using finite computational domains. I will present a
recent effort to understand these problems mathematically (with M-S.
Dupuy) and numerical methods to compute these properties efficiently
(with I. Duchemin, L. Genovese, E. Letournel and S. Ruget), with example
applications in condensed matter physics and chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Space-time formalisms for efficient cubic scaling GW calculations : physics and chemistry taking parallel paths</strong></p>
<p>Among a large spectrum of methods targeting the calculation of electronic energy levels, as given e.g. by photoemission experiments, the many-body Green&rsquo;s function GW formalism [1], originally developed in condensed matter physics for a better description of the band structure of inorganic semiconductors and insulators, has recently gained much visibility in quantum chemistry for its ability to offer an excellent accuracy to cost ratio, allowing the study of systems comprising a few hundred atoms. Very early in the history of GW, the so-called &ldquo;space-time&rdquo; approach [2] was proposed for cubic-scaling GW calculations, but such an approach was hardly ever used. We will present an effective reformulation of this technique in the quantum chemistry framework of all electron-calculations with atomic orbitals basis sets, using the Laplace transform approach, a novel analytic continuation technique adapted to the GW problem [3], and a real-space-grid separable-resolution-of-the-identity formalism that walks in the footstep of previous real-space grid techniques for Coulomb integrals calculations (chain-of-sphere, tensor-hyper-contraction, etc.) [4,5] We show that cubic scaling RPA and GW calculations on up to a thousand atoms can be achieved within a few thousand hours with hardly any loss of accuracy, offering a crossover with traditional calculations taking place at small system sizes.</p>

<p><strong>Ab initio description of doubly open-shell nuclei via a novel multi-reference perturbation theory</strong></p>
<p>Recent developments in many-body theory and in the modelling of nuclear Hamiltonians have enabled the ab initio description of a considerable fraction of atomic nuclei up to mass $A \sim 100$. In this context, one of the main challenges consists in devising a method that can tackle doubly open-shell systems and at the same time scales gently with mass number. This would allow both to access all systems below $A \sim 100$ and to open up perspectives for extending ab initio calculations to the whole nuclear chart.
Here I present a recently proposed many-body approach that aims towards this objective. After introducing the formalism based on a multi-reference perturbation theory [1], I will discuss the first numerical applications [2,3] together with considerations on the state of the art and future perspective in ab initio nuclear structure.</p>

<p><strong>Ab initio calculation of low-lying excitations in strongly-correlated systems: RelaxSE</strong></p>
<p>Strongly-correlated systems present the peculiar characteristic that their low- energy physical and chemical properties are not driven by the kinetic energy of their Fermi-level electrons. In these systems, the electron-electron correlation, sub-dominant or even negligible in most systems, is much larger than the kinetic energy. As a consequence, they cannot be properly described by a single Slater determinant and such methods usually give poor results for the ground state as well as the low-lying magnetic states.
Accurate calculation of this kind of excitation requires specifically-designed methods. The CAS+DDCI (Complete Active Space + Difference Dedicated Configurations Interaction) [1] method has been proved successful for systems with a small number of magnetic orbitals per atom. However it quickly reaches a computational wall when the number of magnetic orbitals increases. The SAS+S (Selected Active Space + Single) [2] method which has been developed in our group a few years ago, is able to go beyond the CAS+DDCI limitations. After a brief introduction on the problem at stake, I will recall the principle of the SAS+S method and present the new RelaxSE [3] software which we developed in order to treat these excitations.</p>

<p><strong>Excitonic effects in electronic structure calculations: spectra and beyond.</strong></p>
<p>Excitonic effects have proved to be crucial for the quantitative description of
optical absorption [1]. This picture has been confirmed for core excitations [2].
The description of excitons can be conducted, within the many-body Green&rsquo;s
functions formalism, via the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), which
takes the electron-hole interaction, in the presence of all the
other electrons, automatically into account. More recently, we have put a lot of
effort into extending the applicability of the BSE towards: i) different
spectroscopies (like electron and photon scattering [3-5]), ii) unconventional picture
(excitonic band-structure [6]), and iii) pictorial tools (of the electron density
evolution). In this seminar I will illustrate the achievements and problems
of the BSE in tackling these new spectroscopies and tools.</p>

<p><strong>Phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen including nuclear quantum effects</strong></p>
<p>We compute the phase diagram of hydrogen and deuterium at low temperatures and high pressures (P &gt; 300GPa) correctly accounting for accurate electronic correlations by quantum Monte Carlo, and for nuclear quantum effects and anharmonicity by the self-consistent harmonic approximation. We predict that phase III transits into the molecular metallic phase VI at 412(+/- 40) GPa, then to the atomic phase at pressures as large as 577(+/- 10) GPa. The transition pressures increase by 30 GPa and 63 GPa, respectively, if hydrogen is replaced with deuterium. Our results strongly support the experimental claim of a phase transition occurring at about 425 GPa into a metallic non-superconducting phase. However, for the atomic superconducting phase our data suggest much larger transition pressures than those predicted so far.</p>

<p><strong>Large-coupling strength expansion in DFT and Hartree-Fock adiabatic connections</strong></p>
<p>In this talk I will review and put into perspective several results on the large-coupling strength expansion of two adiabatic connections (AC) widely used in electronic structure theory. The first one is the density fixed [1] AC of DFT that connects the Kohn-Sham determinant with the physical state. Its large-coupling strength limit defines a multimarginal optimal transport problem [2-4], also known in physics as the strictly-correlated-electrons (SCE) functional [5-7]. The second one is the AC that connects the Hartree-Fock Slater determinant with the physical state and has as small-coupling expansion the Møller-Plesset perturbation theory [8-10]. I will discuss differences and similarities between the two large-coupling strength expansions and their use in improving approximations in quantum chemistry [11-15].</p>

<p><strong>New approaches for treating correlation in molecule and solids</strong></p>
<p>In this work I will give an overview of recent progress made on various topics related to (strong) electron correlation.</p>
<ol>
<li>We propose an original approach for the study of periodic Coulomb systems. We use a Clifford torus with a renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential. We have successfully applied this strategy to the calculation of Madelung constants and Wigner crystals. We also propose a new position operator that is compatible with periodic boundary conditions.</li>
<li>To capture satellites or shake-up excitations in photo-emission spectra we propose to use the three-body Green’s function instead of the usual one-body Green’s function, i.e. we increase the size of the excitation space from the quasi-particle energies to include also electron-hole pairs. In our approach static effective many-body potentials can capture satellite structures in the spectral function.</li>
<li>We show that the extended Koopmans’ theorem (EKT), from which charged excitations can be obtained, is linked to the many-body effective energy theory (MEET) that we derived to calculate the spectral function. Using this link we have extended the EKT to the calculation of the spectral function.</li>

<p><strong>Incorporating many-body and environment effects on core and luminescence properties</strong></p>
<p>X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and luminescence time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) are all spectroscopic techniques that can probe the coordination and local environment around a given complex.
The first part of the talk will be devoted to the interpretation of luminescence spectra of uranium(VI), since its speciation is a key challenge in the context of the nuclear fuel cycle. Owing to its high sensitivity and selectivity time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) is particularly suited for such studies. However, most of the relevant systems have complex chemical composition in solution and the identification of each species from spectroscopic data is challenging. We will detail our efforts in developing an ab initio-based interpretation of TRLFS data. We will illustrate that TD-DFT with the CAM-B3LYP functional is able to remedy the flaws  that plagued previous applications of DFT in the determination of vertical excitation and emission energies for these systems. We will illustrate how one can predict vibrationally resolved spectra useful it is to assign the recorded TRLFS data [1, 2, 3].</p>
<p>The second part of this presentation will focus on core spectra of hydrated halides, owing to their relevance to atmospheric chemistry. We resort to quantum chemical methods in the framework of quantum embedding approaches [4] since these, at the same time, allow for the halogen can in principle be treated at a sufficiently high level of theory (to account, for example, for both correlation and relaxation effects [5] due to the creation of the core hole), while still retaining a quantum description for the whole system (so that we can obtain information from, or couplings to, the environment) and achieving an overall reduction of computational effort. We will present the recent implementation (in the non-relativistic framework) and carry out a first assessment of the performance of two quantum embedding approaches, frozen density embedding (FDE) and the block-orthogonalized Manby-Miller embedding (BOMME), for the calculation of XAS for model systems, employing real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) [6].</p>

<p><strong>Towards computing efficently cumulants in Monte Carlo, exchange cluster estimators</strong></p>
<p>Response properties or cumulants are usually size-extensive ($O(N)$) but are
computed in  Monte Carlo with fluctuations growing like $N^p$ with $p&gt;1$ as a
function of the system size $N$.
The limit of this problem is the sign problem where the ferminonic energy
can be written as an infinite expansion of cumulants and the fluctuations
are growing exponentially with the system size.</p>
<p>We propose a  method that selects clusters of variables belonging to two
independent replicas of the system. These clusters behave as if they were
independent,  enabling a factorization of correlation functions.
The algorithm generalizes cluster algorithms (usually applied to spin
problems, like the Wolf algorithm or the exchange cluster algorithm) but
can be applied  to any model  of interacting particles with any $p$-body
interactions ($p=1,2,3 \dots $).
An improved estimator of the heat capacity (a covariance)  is then
proposed and tested on the Lennard Jones Model.
In practice the  scaling of the statistical fluctuations as a function of
the number of degrees of freedom $N$ is reduced  from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$
above the critical temperature.
Generalization to higher cumulants will be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>London dispersion forces without density distortion: The Fixed Diagonal Matrices method</strong></p>
<p>The development of Density Functional Theory (DFT) has allowed for the routine use of calculations to support and explain experimental findings in chemistry at a reasonable computational cost. DFT, however, is not without its limitations. In particular there are two phenomena that remain its Achilles heel, strong correlation and London dispersion interactions. The difficulty in describing strong correlation is shared with the competing (post-Hartree-Fock) wavefunction methods, but the difficulty in describing dispersion interactions is rather specific to DFT.</p>
<p>Attempts at building non-local functionals to capture dispersion have been somewhat successful[1,2], especially in calculations on solids[3], but they are outcompeted in practical calculations on molecules by empirical corrections based on pairwise atomic dispersion coefficients derived from free atoms[4] ¬or on free atomic polarizabilities combined with dipole moments of the exchange hole[5]. However, these empirical corrections are only able to take into account effects of the chemical environment of the atom in a limited way and cannot model anisotropy in the dispersion coefficients.</p>
<p>In our recent work[6-8] we have introduced a class of variational wavefunctions that capture the long-range interaction between neutral systems (atoms and molecules) without changing the diagonal of the density matrix of each monomer.  As the individual monomer densities are kept fixed, we can also unambiguously assess the effect of the density distortion on London dispersion interactions: for example, we obtain virtually exact dispersion coefficients between two hydrogen atoms up to C10, and relative errors below 0.2% in the case of two helium atoms.[6]  From a theoretical perspective the method raises interesting questions regarding the Hohenberg-Kohn, Virial and Hellmann-Feynman Theorems, which we have answered, together with providing a solid mathematical basis for the theory.[7]</p>
<p>In benchmarks our so called Fixed Diagonal Matrices (FDM) method performs satisfactorily for closed-shell atoms and molecules when used with accurate (CCSD) pair densities, producing a Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) and Max Absolute Error (AMAX) of 7.1% and 18.2% for isotropic dispersion coefficients C6, respectively.[8] The method performs as well for anisotropic dispersion coefficients and can in principle be incorporated self-consistently.[7] For open-shell atoms improvements must still be made, by improving the wavefunction and/or the dispersal basisset.</p>

<p><strong>Photoemission spectroscopy from the three-body Green’s function</strong></p>
<p>We present an original approach for the calculation of direct and inverse photo-emission spectra from first principles. The main goal is to go beyond the standard Green’s function approaches, such as the GW method, in order to find a good description not only of the quasiparticles but also of the satellite structures, which are of particular importance in strongly correlated materials. Our method uses as a key quantity the three-body Green’s function, or, more precisely, its hole-hole- electron and electron-electron-hole parts. We show that, contrary to the one-body Green’s function, satellites are already present in the corresponding non-interacting Green’s function. Therefore, simple approximations to the three-body self-energy, which is defined by the Dyson equation for the three-body Green’s function and which contains many-body effects, can still yield accurate spectral functions. In particular, the self-energy can be chosen to be static which could simplify a self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation. We also show how the one-body Green’s function can be retrieved from the three-body Green’s function. We illustrate our approach by applying it to the symmetric Hubbard dimer.</p>

<p><strong>Wigner localization in two and three dimensions: an ab initio approach</strong></p>
<p>We investigate Wigner localization at very low densities by means of the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. This yields numerically exact results. In particular, we study a system of two electrons in one, two and three dimensions. Our approach consists of three main principles: (i) the creation of a supercell that has the topology of a $d$-dimensional Clifford torus, which is a flat, finite, and borderless manifold; (ii) the renormalization of the distance between two points on the Clifford torus by defining it as the Euclidean distance in the embedding space of the $d$-Clifford torus; (iii) we use a grid of equidistant spherical gaussians as a basis for the Hamiltonian.[1] We have extended the approach to two and three dimensions by using the translational symmetry of the system to efficiently calculate the electronic wave function. We have validated our approach by comparing our results to a semi-classical model that becomes exact in the low-density limit. With our approach we are able to observe the Wigner localization by means of the two-body reduced density matrix without ambiguity.[2] We have recently generalised our approach to electron gases with more than 2 electrons and we have obtained promising preliminary results.</p>

<p><strong>Practical error bounds for electronic structure calculations: energy, density matrices and forces</strong></p>
<p>In the field of quantum chemistry, solving electronic structure problems gives rise to a certain number of approximations so that in practice, only approximations of quantities that are of interest (QoI) can be computed. Being able to estimate the error between the exact and the approximate quantities is thus crucial, as this information can be used to reduce the high computational cost of numerical methods by an optimization of the approximation parameters, together, and maybe more importantly, to add error bars to QoI calculated from the approximate solution. In our context, such QoI are typically the total energy of the system and the forces on the atoms in the system.
While such error bounds have been developed already some time ago for boundary value problems, the developments of such error bounds in electronic structure are still recent and incomplete. So far, no error bound has been proposed for the error estimation of QoI in electronic structure calculations, in particular for the forces of the system. This is what we are trying to achieve in this contribution, by developing new error estimators for nonlinear models, nonguaranted but valid asymptotically.
These bounds are based on an estimation of the error in terms of the residual of the solved equations, which is then efficiently approximated with computable terms. We numerically show how accurate these bounds are on a few representative materials systems, namely silicon, gallium arsenide and titanium dioxide.</p>

<p><strong>Recent Progress in the Development of Eco-Friendly Processed Organic Solar Cells: Experiments and Theory</strong></p>
<p>Synergic effects concerning electronic structure and morphology in the PTB7-Th polymer and the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC molecule has resulted in state-of-art systems for organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving over 12% PCE values [1]. Furthermore, the substitution of harmful halogenated solvents to environmentally friendly solvents that do not compromise PCE values has become a subject of great interest in the literature [2].
In this work, we employed sulfur K-edge Angle-Resolved Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), Resonant Auger (RAS), and the Core-Hole Clock spectroscopies in an attempt to gain information on the effect of different processing methods on the elec- tronic and morphological properties of these systems. These spectroscopic measurements (NEXAFS, RAES and XPS) were carried out at the SXS beamline of the Brazilian Syn- chrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS).
In order to compare the use of an conventional acceptor molecule, we have performed Steady State and Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) experiments for neat PTB7- Th and blends with ITIC and PCBM. TRPL measurements were carried at the Swansea’s Material Research Centre.
To a better comprehension of the sulfur excited states involved in the electronic tran- sitions probed by the synchrotron-based-spectroscopic methods, theoretical calculations were performed utilizing Restricted-Excitation-Window Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (REW-TD-DFT). In order to probe the extent of relativistic effects present in these transitions, we employed different Hamiltonians (ZORA, DKH, X2C) in our calculations.
We also explored different chemical descriptors (the Donor-Acceptor and Aromatic- Quinoid approaches) to obtain information at valence level in both ground and low-lying excited states. All calculations were performed in NWChem 7.0, Gaussian16 and Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF).</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Relativistic Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory</strong></p>
<p>The applicability of reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is increasing among the chemists and physicist communities. Recent studies using the Hubbard model have proven that some RDMFT functional approximations are suitable for studying systems where strong electron correlation effects are dominant[1-2]. Moreover, as another example, RDMFT has been recently adapted as an alternative methodology to study superconductivity[3].
To further extend RDMFT applicability, we introduce in this work its relativistic version. Relativistic RDMFT is presented using the Dirac 4-component Hamiltonian and including the effects of creation and annihilation of electron-positron pairs. To this end, we have properly adapted the recent work of Toulouse[4], where relativistic density functional theory including effective quantum electron dynamics was established. Then, considering the so-called no-pair approximation[4] we also present the relativistic version of some of the most accurate RDMFT functional approximations[6-7]. Finally, we analyze some properties of these functional approximations.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-basis-set TDDFT methods for predicting electron attachment energies</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the interaction of low-energy electron collisions with molecules constitutes a key subject in a large area of fundamental research as well as modern applications in various fields of science such as astrochemistry, radiation-induced damage of biological tissue, selective chemistry, or chemical synthesis at nanoscale.
Collision of a low energy electron with a molecule can induce various phenomenon such as dissociation, ionization, isomerization, reactivity, etc, through the formation of a transient negative anion composed of the target molecule and the projectile electron, that can evolve toward a dissociative state through selective phenomenon.
A complete theoretical characterization of the temporary anion, which would describe the electron attachment, the relaxation of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, and possible fragmentation processes, is still challenging. Limitations come from the difficulty to treat the electron correlation in an anionic system, the need to combine continuum and discrete states, and the high number of degrees of freedom, which make the numerical calculation very cumbersome.
Among the most popular computational methods for describing temporary anions , one can find a broad class of methods that compute the electron attachment energies, such as the R-matrix , the so-called empirical correlation method , the Schwinger multichannel method , or the stabilization method . Although these methods provide valuable results, they rely either on cumbersome
calculations or on empirical methods.
Here, we propose an efficient approach to predict the resonance energies of the electron attachment using a TDDFT calculation and two different atomic basis sets6: a large basis set to compute the vertical electron affinity, and a smaller one to calculate the excitation energy of the anion. Doing so one computes the relevant resonant attachment energies of the electron without intruder states from the continuum discretized due to the finite size of the simulation box. Benchmarks have been performed over 18 molecules and 53 resonances and show good agreement with experimental data.</p>

<p><strong>Valence Bond alternative yielding compact and accurate wave functions for challenging excited states. Application to ethylene, ozone and sulfur dioxide</strong></p>
<p>Calculating excited states properties and transition energies can be a tough task even for small molecules. If the ground and excited states are of different symmetries, state-specific calculations can be performed, but it is essential that the correlation energies be calculated in a balanced way for both states. This can be difficult when the two states have very different demands of dynamic electron correlation, for instance with ionic excited states displaying a lot of dynamic charge fluctuation. If the two states are of like symmetry, a state-averaged treatment can be used, but the accuracy is penalized by the necessity for both states to share the same orbital set, which is a compromise that cannot be optimal for either of the two states.
It will be shown that these two difficulties can be resolved by the breathing-orbital valence bond method (BOVB), which exerts a direct approach to both static and dynamic electron correlations, made possible by the freedom to deal with non-orthogonal orbitals. The dynamic correlation is fully included right at the orbital optimization step, by allowing each VB structure to have its specific set of orbitals, and, in the newly developed state-averaged BOVB method, by also having the unique advantage to be free from the constraint for the different states to share the same unique set of orbitals.
This approach is tested on the challenging $1{}^{1}B_{1u}$ ionic state of ethylene, and to the five lowest-lying singlet states of ozone and sulfur dioxide, among which the challenging $1{}^{1}B_2$ and $2{}^{1}A_1$ states. In all cases, it will be shown that the calculated vertical energies are close to the experimental values when available, and at par with the most sophisticated calculations in the molecular orbital framework, despite the extreme compactness of the BOVB wave functions (no more than 4-9 valence bond structures in all cases). Finally, the description of the excited states also come out to be insightful, and displays some important, albeit unexpected, Lewis structures.</p>

<p><strong>Bogoliubov coupled cluster theory for open-shell nuclei</strong></p>
<p>The objective of the so-called ab initio approach to nuclear structure is to provide an accurate and universal description of nuclear systems from first principles [1]. In this context, solving the many-body Schrödinger equation requires systematically improvable many-body methods. Over the past 20 years, the development of novel expansion methods displaying a mild computational scaling with systems size have allowed access to mid-mass closed-shell nuclei. Such methods typically expand the exact ground-state wave-function around a reference/unperturbed Slater determinant and include correlations through elementary particle-hole excitations. This can be obtained from perturbative techniques [2] or from non-perturbative approaches such as coupled-cluster (CC) theory [3]. While closed-shell nuclei are well under control, the extension to open-shell nuclei remains a major challenge.
Only very recently, a novel many-body method coined as Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC) theory [4] has been formulated that extends the standard coupled cluster scheme to singly open-shell nuclei. This is achieved by breaking particle-number symmetry of the unperturbed state as a way to already incorporate crucial static correlations into it. In my talk I will present recent results obtained for the ground-state of oxygen isotopes based on nuclear interaction models derived from chiral effective field theory.
Once fully implemented, the non-perturbative (equation-of-motion) BCC method will allow for high-precision ab initio calculations of ground and excited states in medium-mass nuclei.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum Dynamics with a Smolyak scheme: numerical developments and applications</strong></p>
<p>When solving the time-dependent or time-independent Schrödinger equations associated to the atomic motions, the major bottleneck is the size of the direct-product basis set or grid which increases exponentially as a function of the number of degrees of freedom, $n$. All the usual numerical techniques (use of symmetry, clever selection of coordinates, separation of motions, basis set and grids adapted to model Hamiltonians, contraction of basis set and grids &hellip;) fail to attenuate this exponential scaling. A way to overcome this difficulty is to perform a multidimensional basis function selection in terms of excitations as for vibrational-SCF or VSCF methods. However, when a multidimensional grid is required, the exponential scaling is still present.
With the Smolyak scheme,[1] the exponential scaling is avoided for both basis set and grid and a wave function can be represented as follows:
$$ | \Psi \rangle  = \sum_{\mathbf{\ell}} D_{\mathbf{\ell}} | \Psi^{\mathbf{\ell}} \rangle $$
In this sum, each term, $| \Psi^{\mathbf{\ell}} \rangle$, parametrized by $\mathbf{\ell}$ ($\mathbf{\ell} = [\ell_1,\ell_2,\ldots,\ell_n])$, is expanded on a small
direct-product (basis set and/or grid). The number of terms in the sum is constrained
through a relation on $|\ell|$ ($|\ell| = \sum_{i=1}^{n})$) such as: $|\ell| \le L$ (other constraints are possible),
hence, this limits the overall grid and basis set sizes. The scaling as function of $n$ becomes polynomials of degree $L$.</p>
<p>In quantum dynamics, Avila and Carrington [2-5] and ourselves [6-9] were pioneers in developing efficient implementations to study the vibrational energy levels of molecules [6- 9] or reactive collisions. [9] Here, we will show that it is possible to apply this Smolyak scheme to large molecule ($n&gt;20$) and also to extend it to wave packet propagation. Furthermore, with a system/bath separation, one can deal with about 100 degrees of freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Partition Monte-Carlo : Reducing Fluctuation Scaling in Large Systems</strong></p>
<p>For an ab-initio calculation on a $N$-particle electronic system, Variational Monte Carlo methods provide a result with a time scaling $O(N^3)$. However, they suffer from numerical uncertainties increasing with system size, caracterised by their variance which generally scales as $O(N)$. The traditional compensation method transfers the uncertainties onto the simulation time, in order to obtain a given level of accuracy, resulting in an effective $O(N^4)$ scaling. We present a new control variate method employing the zero-variance principle and a partition of the system which allows us to reduce the variance for a limited increase in computation time, by $O(N)$ on metallic systems and up to $O(N^2)$ on systems with a finite correlation length, and will present results on the example of the Hubbard model.</p>

<p><strong>Exploiting the seniority number in calculations of molecular excited states</strong></p>
<p>In electronic structure theory, configuration interaction and coupled
cluster methods are usually built hierarchically based on the truncation
of the excitation degree from a given reference determinant. However,
one can devise new truncation schemes that further incorporates the
concept of seniority (number of unpaired electrons of a determinant). In
the first part of this contribution, I will present our recently
developed state-specific orbital-optimized pair coupled cluster doubles
model, where the excitation operator is restricted to double excitations
with seniority zero. Instead of relying on the equation-of-motion
formalism, this approach targets both ground and excited states within
the coupled cluster formalism, thus promising a more balanced
description of correlation effects. Its accuracy has been assessed
against alternative methodologies and full configuration interaction
results, for a set of doubly-excited states of small molecules. Our
model provided very reliable excitation energies, at a fraction of the
computational cost of alternative methodologies. I will further
illustrate how it compares with the much more expensive doubly-occupied
configuration interaction method, the crucial role of orbital
optimization, and the differences between projective and variational
formulations. In the second part of the contribution, I will present a
new hierarchy of configuration interaction methods which are based on
both the excitation degree and the seniority number, as well as initial
results for ground state potential energy curves and excitation
energies.</p>

<p><strong>Noncovalent interactions from models for the Møller-Plesset adiabatic connection</strong></p>
<p>The adiabatic connection (AC) that has as weak-interaction expansion the Møller-Plesset (MP) perturbation series has been recently shown to have a large coupling-strength expansion in terms of functionals of the Hartree-Fock density [1,2]. Based on these findings, in this work [3] we introduce a new class of functionals that approximate directly the MP AC by interpolating between MP2 and the large-coupling strength limit, which is size consistent for fragments with a non-degenerate ground state [4]. These functionals have the same cost as double hybrids and greatly reduce the large MP2 errors for typical pi-stacking complexes (e.g., benzene-pyridine dimers) and for the L7 dataset. Furthermore, they are also competitive with state-of-the-art dispersion enhanced functionals and can even significantly outperform them for a variety of datasets, such as CT7, DI6 and L7.</p>

We develop two strategies: (1) configuration-interaction calculations where the basis-set correction is included self-consistently [4], and (2) coupled-cluster calculations where the basis-set correction is estimated non-self-consistently using numerical differentiation of the energy with respect to an electric field.

<p><strong>Efficient Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations with Large Atomic Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods use a stochastic approach to solve the Schrödinger
equation. Their scaling with the system size considering the computational costs is very
favourable and a great flexibility in the choice of the wave function allows to efficiently treat
both dynamical as well as static correlation. This makes QMC methods for instance particu-
larly useful for the description of excited states. [1,2]
However, the steep scaling with the atomic number $Z$ is a remaining challenge. Different
regions in space exhibit different time scales and contribute to a varying degree to the overall
variance in a Variational Monte Carlo algorithm. This leads to large inefficiencies as the
same computational effort is spend on all regions. We propose a Monte Carlo scheme which
exploits that core regions are physically independent in a molecule to almost remove their high
variance contribution to the numerical cost. [3] The method relies on efficiently subsampling the
core regions using independent sidewalks which can be understood as constructing on the fly
an exact stochastic effective core potential. Results are presented on atoms, alkane chains and
clusters of silicons which display a gain in numerical efficiency between one and two orders of
magnitude.
The extension to more advanced projector Monte Carlo methods is being explored.</p>

<p><strong>Benchmark on cobalt systems relevant for reactivity</strong></p>
<p>The high cost and low availability of second- and third-row transition metals push more and more researchers to explore the chemistry of the first-row transition metals. Their use in catalysis needs a fine understanding of their electron properties, which could be achieved by theoretical approaches. Nevertheless, the computational study of first-row transition complexes and their reactivity rises nu- merous questions, as several electronic states could be accessible.
Among known reactivities, cobalt complexes have been used for more than ten years to perform cycloaddition reactions. Recently, in our group, a [CpCo] mediated chemodivergent cycloaddition has been studied.[1] General mechanisms proposed for this kind of reactivity usually rely on den- sity functional theory calculations (employing hybrid functionals) and involve a two-state reactivity. However, and as expected, for some of the key intermediates, a pure density functional would predict a more stable singlet state, while a hybrid functional, such as B3LYP, would predict a more stable triplet state. We used wavefunction based methods on a series of model cobalt and rhodium sys- tems to compute singlet-triplet splittings in order to benchmark the performances of common density functionals in our mechanistic studies. This also represents an opportunity to gain methodological insights on the computational treatment of organometallic catalysts. Using correlated wavefunction methods such as MRCI and CASPT2/RASPT2 on systems of increasing size, we assess the influence of basis set selection, active space and restrictions to the CI expansion or semi-core correlation on the relative spin state energetics.[2, 3] CCSD(T) and BCCD(T) calculations were also performed to check the extent of their reliability in treating transition metal complexes with a possibly multicon- figurational wavefunction. [4, 5] In the process, we aim at finding a suitable cost/accuracy balance to treat systems of chemical interest, select the appropriate density functional and assess the validity of proposed mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Timescale of local moment screening across and above the Mott transition</strong></p>
<p>In a material’s phase diagram the types of realized long-range orders typically correspond to instabilities in static response functions. In correlated systems, however, key phenomena crucially depend on dynamical processes too: In a Mott insulator, the electrons’ spin moment fluctuates in time, while it is dynamically screened in Kondo systems. Here, we introduce a timescale tm characteristic for the screening of the local spin moment and demonstrate that it fully characterizes the dynamical mean-field phase diagram of the Hubbard model: The retarded magnetic response delineates the Mott transition and provides a new perspective on its signatures in the supercritical region above. We show that tm has knowledge of the Widom line and that it can be used to demarcate the Fermi liquid from the bad metal regime. Additionally, it reveals new structures inside the Fermi liquid phase: First, we identify a region with preformed local moments that we suggest to have a thermodynamic signature. Second, approaching the Mott transition from weak coupling, we discover a regime in which the spin dynamics becomes adiabatic, in the sense that it is much slower than valence fluctuations. Our findings provide resolution limits for magnetic measurements and may build a bridge to the relaxation dynamics of non-equilibrium states</p>

resulting algorithm is fully automatic and does not require the user to
select a damping. We successfully apply it to a wide range of

<p><strong>Ensemble DFT for charged and neutral excitations</strong></p>
<p>Density-functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT) are known to possess deficiencies when it comes to computing charged and neutral excitations.
Indeed, one would usually turn to TD-DFT to get accurate transition energies for low-lying excited states with a relatively moderate computational cost.
However, within this formalism, double excitations are completely absent from the spectra of TD-DFT and the quality of the excitation energies highly depends on the choice of the exchange-correlation functional which is usually treated in the standard adiabatic approximation.
In ensemble DFT (eDFT), it is possible to extract any excitation energies from a single calculation through a Gross-Oliveira-Kohn (GOK) ensemble with a similar computational cost and level of approximation for the exchange-correlation functional than in an usual pure-state DFT calculation [1]. There also exists a similar formalism from which one can extract charged excitations like ionization potentials, electron affinities or even fundamental gaps in a single eDFT calculation, the Perdew-Parr-Levy and Balduz (PPLB) ensemble formalism [2].
In DFT it is known that the Kohn-Sham gap can be a very poor estimation of the fundamental gap of the physical system but, in an ensemble picture, it is possible to considerably improve this estimation through the well-known derivative discontinuity which can be directly connected to the weight-dependence of the xc-functional. While this improvement can be quite consequent for small finite systems, it is still problematic when it comes to large periodic systems like cristalline solids. Indeed, for such systems, extracting charged excitations will require to induce a same small variation of the number of electrons in every unit cell of the system which will inexorably lead to an infinitely large charge for the whole system.
Very recently, a new grand canonical eDFT formalism has been developed, the N-centered formalism, which allows the extraction of charged excitation energies without changing the number of electrons [3].
We will discuss and present those various eDFT formalisms through their applications to very simple systems [4,5].</p>

<p><strong>Calculation and effect of interaction parameters on oxygen $p$ orbitals in oxides, examples of UO$_2$ and TiO$_2$</strong></p>
<p>The standard method for solid state physics ab initio calculation is the Density Functional Theory (DFT). However, the most used functionals such as LDA or GGA fail to give a correct description of the density of states and structural parameters of strongly correlated systems. The DFT+U improves this description by explicitly applying electronic interaction inside specific orbitals.
This method is extensively used in f and d orbitals of transition metals, lanthanides, actinides and their oxides compounds. However, the interaction effects occurring in the p orbitals of the oxide have been shown to play an important role in the density of states and structural parameters of some of those systems. [1, 2, 3]
In this presentation, we use our generalized cRPA implementation (as described in [4] and based on [5]), to calculate the screened interaction on both metal ($d$ or $f$) and oxygen ($p$) orbitals . We also discuss the influence of those interactions on density of state and structural parameters on two widely studied systems, UO$_2$ and TiO$_2$. We show that due to the hybridization of $p$ electrons the electronic occupations have to be carefully calculated in order to ensure physical results.</p>

<p><strong>Many-body perturbative calculations for multi-excitons in perovskite nanocrystals</strong></p>
<p>Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are among the most fashionable names nowadays in the field of colloidal synthesis owing to their superior photoluminescence quantum yield and blinking-free properties, which make them promising materials for both classical [1,2] and quantum light sources [3,4]. Their brightness and sub-nanosecond radiative decay originates from the inherent correlation effects [5,6]. The many-body Coulomb interaction has generally been studied for semiconductor quantum dots [7,8]. Perovskites, as a consequence of the unique properties of their dielectric functions, possess enhanced Coulomb interaction between the charge carriers [9]. This leads to large binding energies of multi-exciton systems such as trion and biexciton in these NCs or the sizable splitting in the fine structure of single exciton states. Considering each NC as an artificial atom under the envelope function approximation, this problem of correlation effects can be approached at first by using second-order many-body techniques as outlined in Ref. [10]. This offers an elegant and efficient method that provides qualitative results for the trion and biexciton binding energies [11]. In going beyond the second-order description, configuration interaction can be employed to include the correlation energies between the various charge carriers in a more holistic manner.</p>

<p><strong>Iterative CI wavefunction optimization using a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian and Variational Monte Carlo</strong></p>
<p>Realizing full Configuration Interaction (CI) for a one-electron basis sets is, in general, not possible
in practice. One needs to truncate the CI wavefunction according to some protocol. To recover the
remaining correlation energy, one can explicitly include correlations in the wavefunction or in the
Hamiltonian.
In the framework of the transcorrelated approach, the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is given
by $\tilde{\mathcal{H}} = \mathcal{J}^{-1} \mathcal{H} \mathcal{J}$ where $\mathcal{J}$ is a correlation operator. Although
$\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ is not Hermitian, it allows to effectively incorporate dynamical correlation effects, with relatively small one-electron basis sets.
Formally, we can write the wavefunction as $\Psi \equiv \mathcal{J} \Phi$ where $\Phi = \sum_{I=1}^{N_\text{det}} c_I D_I$. The Schroedinger
equation in this case is written as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H} \Psi = E \Psi \Leftrightarrow \tilde{\mathcal{H}} \Phi = E \Phi
\end{equation}
In this work, we develop an iterative method to optimize large CI wavefunctions in the presence
of a Jastrow correlation factor, optimized at the Hartree-Fock level. The Slater-determinant part $\Phi$ is
modified at each iteration by a symmetric dressing of $\tilde{\mathcal{H}}$ with the dressing elements $\langle D_I | \tilde{\mathcal{H}} - \mathcal{H} | \Phi \rangle$
Moreover, the non-hermeticity of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is dressed by applying a symmetric
dressing of the Hamiltonian. The dressing elements, which contain two- and three-electrons integrals,
are sampled in a Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Describing conical intersections with near term quantum computers</strong></p>
<p>In quantum computing, solving the electronic structure problem is considered as the “killer application” for near term quantum computers. To treat this problem, a great focus has been paid to hybrid-classical-quantum algorithms such as the well-known “Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver” (VQE). While VQE has been proficiently applied to find electronic eigenstates/energies of various small molecules, using this approach on more complex systems is still a genuine challenge especially when peculiar spectral features such as conical intersections are present.
In nature, conical intersections play a keyrole in many prominent reactions. For instance, in the process of vision: the retinal molecule is known to undergo a photoisomerisation mediated by a non-radiative relaxation through a conical intersection. In such a situation, characterizing the phenomenon requires to precisely describe the shape of the conical intersection, with both qualitative and quantitative high-level treatments. This makes it a difficult target to current quantum algorithms, such as VQE.
Motivated by this problem, we recently introduced a new quantum algorithm [1] called the “State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized VQE” (SA-OO-VQE) designed to treat on an equal footing degenerate states on near term quantum computers. In this talk, we introduce the theory of SA- OO-VQE and illustrate how it works on the formaldimine molecule (a minimal model for the retinal with a similar conical intersection). Furthermore, we will introduce new extensions to the SA-OO- VQE algorithm recently developed to estimate nuclear gradients and non-adiabatic couplings out of the quantum algorithm [2]. We show that SA-OO-VQE is able to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce the molecule’s conical intersection. We will also show that the algorithm can be used in a geometry optimization process to find the minimal energy conical intersection of the molecule.</p>

<p><strong>Assessing MP2 frozen natural orbitals in relativistic correlated electronic structure</strong></p>
<p>The $O(N^6)$ high computational cost is a bottleneck preventing performing Coupled-Cluster (CC) on large systems, particularly when employing 4-component based relativistic Hamiltonians, for which in practice one often uses uncontracted basis set generating large virtual molecular orbital (VMO) spaces.
The canonical Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals are not the most compact representation for post HF method. Alternative, using natural orbitals is an efficient way to reduce the orbital space while retaining accuracy. We therefore implemented the MP2 frozen natural orbital (FNO) method [1] in the Exacorr code [2], with the particularity that our implementation can generate both complex and quaternion FNOs, and also express these in AO basis. It also allows us to obtain CCSD natural orbitals on AO basis, which can be subsequently used in analysis.
We have investigated the orbital truncation errors for both correlation energy (at CCSD(T) level) and molecular properties (at CCSD level) such as the electric field gradients at the nuclei (EFGs ), dipole and quadrupole moments for hydrogen halides HX (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At, Ts), and parity violation energy shift for the H2X2 systems (X= O, S, Se, Te, Po). We find that using FNOs accelerates the convergence of the correlation energy in a roughly uniform manner across the periodic table and that, with VMO spaces truncated to around half of the complete ones, we obtain reliable estimates for both energies and molecular properties in the complete VMO spaces.</p>
